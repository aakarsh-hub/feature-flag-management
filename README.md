# Feature Flag Management

A robust feature flagging system for controlled rollouts and experimentation.

## Purpose

This system enables product teams to safely deploy features to production while maintaining complete control over their visibility and availability. It supports gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and instant feature toggles without code deployments.

## Main Features

- **Dynamic Feature Toggles**: Enable/disable features in real-time without redeployment
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Progressive release to percentage-based user segments
- **User Targeting**: Target features to specific users, groups, or cohorts
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Built-in experimentation capabilities with statistical analysis
- **Multi-environment Support**: Separate configurations for dev, staging, and production
- **Audit Logging**: Complete history of flag changes and who made them
- **SDK Support**: Client libraries for major languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go)
- **Dashboard UI**: Intuitive interface for managing flags and viewing metrics

## Sample Usage

```python
from feature_flags import FeatureFlagClient

# Initialize the client
client = FeatureFlagClient(api_key='your-api-key')

# Check if feature is enabled for user
if client.is_enabled('new-checkout-flow', user_id='user123'):
    # Show new checkout experience
    render_new_checkout()
else:
    # Show existing checkout
    render_legacy_checkout()

# Get feature variant for A/B testing
variant = client.get_variant('homepage-design', user_id='user123')
if variant == 'control':
    render_homepage_v1()
elif variant == 'treatment':
    render_homepage_v2()
```

## Quick Start

1. Install the SDK: `pip install feature-flag-management`
2. Configure your API credentials
3. Create your first feature flag in the dashboard
4. Integrate flag checks in your application code
5. Monitor rollout metrics and user impact

## Benefits for Product Management

- **Risk Mitigation**: Roll back problematic features instantly
- **Faster Iteration**: Deploy code continuously, release when ready
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Measure impact before full rollout
- **Stakeholder Control**: Non-technical users can manage feature releases
